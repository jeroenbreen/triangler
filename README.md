# triangler
Makes triangle based illustration out of an image.

- Put the image on a `canvas`
- Draw 8 initial triangles and give them the average color of the area they cover
- Check which triangle has the highest deviation in color
- Split this triangle, reset the colors of 2 newly created triangles
- Measure deviation again, split, color, etc, etc
